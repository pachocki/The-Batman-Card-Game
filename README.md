# Batman Card Game
Welcome to the Batman Card Game, a War-style card game featuring characters from the DC and Gotham City universe. The game is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Wow.js. I was responsible for the design, and it was important to create a dark, Gotham City aesthetic.

# Gameplay
The game is played like a traditional War card game. Players take turns rolling dice and comparing their scores. The player with the higher score wins the round and earns points. The game is won by the player who earns the most points over the course of the game.
